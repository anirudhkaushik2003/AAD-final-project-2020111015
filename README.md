## Enemies

The minotaurs are the primary antagonist of the game. They don't want to let Red Riding Hood pass through the forest. The minotaurs are extremely aggressive and if they detect you, they'll chase you around. It is better to attack them from a safe distance as they do a significant amount of damage per hit. They are fast and can jump over obstacles to chase you. Avoid confronting a group of minotaurs and remember to heal if you are low on health.

The objective of the game is to make it through the forest alive while collecting as many flowers as possible for Granny.
